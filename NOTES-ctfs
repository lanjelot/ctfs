server sends c2 to client
gcd = egcd(n1, n2)[0]
p = n1 / gcd
p2 = n2 / gcd
lets assume plaintext message m is a number < p (i.e. it was not padded)
so pow(m, e, n) % p == pow(m, e, p) and d = invmod(e, phy(p)) and p is prime so phy(p) == p-1
we recover d = invmod(0x010001, p-1) and m = pow(c, d, p)

f = (m+1)^3 + 2*m^3 - 1 % n
g = (m+1)^3 - m^3 + 2 % n
m = (f * gmpy.invert(g, n)) % n

    http://pastebin.com/4SQhQXHb
    <ricky> You're given m^3 and (m+1)^3 = m^3 + 3m^2 + 3m + 1

we find g a generator so g^k != 1 % p for 0<k<p-1
and g^(k*(p-1)) = 1 % p for all k>=0
for each m with 0<m<p there exists a x so that m = g^x % p
so we need to find x such that g^(x*(e-1)) = 1 % p
the solutions are solutions of the equation k*(p-1) = x*(e-1)

* rsalot - backdoor-ctf-2015
100 public keys and an RSA-encrypted flag file
two keys must have a moduli n with a common prime factor (can be p or q but it was p in this task)
we find the two keys where n1 = p*q1 and n2 = p*q2 (or n1 = p1*q or n2 = p2*q)
we can then easily factor n1 and n2 by calculating the gcd of n1 and n2: gcd(n1, n2) = p (see gcd.py)
then use rsatool.py -p .. -q .. -o private.pem and openssl rsautl ...

* weak_enc - bctf-2015
lzm compression before encryption = side-channel attack
server encrypts our input as lzm(salt||$input), we can deduce chars in salt by looking at length of ciphertext
first submit empty empty input to have the length of compressed salt
then submit every bigrams to server to find what bigrams are in salt, then do same for trigrams, quadgrams etc. until the first n-gram doesnt yield any new info
once we have a set of n-grams comprising the salt, we try every combination offline to match the null ciphertext
once we have reovered salt, we decrypt target ciphertext by constructing a reverse LSW dictionary

el gamal signature, provided sigs with r reused we can recover private key
https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2015/tree/master/boston-key-party-2015/crypto/wood-island
had also an unintended way
server used the python json library to decode the string into a dict and the
is_duplicate() check was a simple “user_dict in list” so adding a field to the
json was enough to pass the check.

* orient heights - boston-key-party-2015
same as wood island is_duplicate() just compared the binary ASN1 encoding; so again adding a field caused it to fail.

* rsabin - hitcon-ctf-quals-2015
flag size bigger than modulus, we need to bruteforce 22 lost bits (feasible because flag only contains printable chars)
exponent is not invertible so we use the pseudoinverse and the Eli Bendersky's modular_sqrt function to compute 16th roots of c**d
https://ctftime.org/task/1753

* poooooooow - hitcon-ctf-quals-2015
submit x to server with 0<x<p, server returns x^flag % p
best algo to compute discrete logarithm in a group requires more than O(sqrt(q)) time where q is the largest prime factor of the order of the base number
here it would be too slow because
p-1 = 2 * 3^336 * q (with q = 475...41 way too big)
but 2 is a primitive root modulo p, so x = 2^q has order 2*3^336 which is long enough for the flag (which is 50 characters) and only has small prime factors
so we send x = 2^q to server, server returns y and we can solve with Sage:
p, y = .., ..
x = 2**q

* signer and verifier - mma-ctf-2015
forge RSA signature because modular exponentiation distributes over modular multiplication
server has 2 endpoints: signer and verifier
we need to send the signature of the given msg to the verifier to get flag

so we send send msg/divisor to signer to get sig0 and we send divisor to signer to get sig1
and we now have forged the valid signature: sig0 * sig1 % n

* strength - plaid-ctf-2015
egcd, we have (N, e1, c1) and (N, e2, c2) such that gcd(e1, e2) = 1 then we can do egcd(e1, e2) = a1e1 + a2e2 = 1.
c1^a1 * c2^a2 = (m^e1)^a1 * (m^e2)^a2 = m^(e1a1) * m^(e2a2) = m^(e1a1 + e2a2) = m^1 = m (all mod N)
in this case a2 is negative so we have to find the modular multiplicative inverse of the corresponding
ciphertext c2 and calculate b = (gcd(e1, e2)-(a*e1))/e2 so we can calculate c1^a1 * modinv(c2, N)^(-b) % N = m

recover 3 successive outputs to clone the LCG PRNG
LCGs aren't cryptographically secure PRNGs as the internal states and the initial state can be easily recovered from a series of 3 successive outputs
we can see encrypt is a stream cipher that xors the plaintext with the
continuous output of the LCG PRNG which is seeded with a randomly generated
768-bit key. Both the challenge name and the fact that each PRNG state is
defined as state[i+1] = (a*state[i] + b) mod m indicate that the PRNG is a
linear congruential generator.

k^r1 = c1 * m1^-1 mod N, k^r2 = c2 * m2^-1 mod N
egcd(r1, r2) returns g, a, b with  (a * r1) + (b * r2) == 1

* rabit - plaid-ctf-2016
parity oracle - exploit least significant bit oracle using binary-search
in malleable cryptosystems (like RSA or Rabin), the property exists:

y = x^e % N
c' = (c*y) % N = (m^e % N)*(x^e % N) % N = (m^e * x^e) % N = (m*x)^e % N
so we can arbitrarily multiply the plaintext, with Rabin if we multiply ciphertext by 4 we multiply plaintext by 2
we send 4*CT (sqrt_mod(4*CT, N) = sqrt_mod(4, N)*sqrt_mod(CT, N) = 2*PT mod N), if lsb == 0 then 2*PT < N otherwise 2*PT > N

* only9 - asis-ctf-2016
encryption oracle with sbox + matrix and a 9 round key schedule
solve with square attack:
Pick an index i and 256 plaintexts P_k that all differ in byte i, but coincide
in all indexes j != i. Then after 8 rounds, the i-th byte of the XOR of all
ciphertexts C_k of P_k is 0. We can use this to mount a square attack
The final ciphers after 9 rounds are C'_k = M*(SBOX(C_k)) ^ K where K is the
last round key. This can be rewritten as C_k = SBOX^-1((M^-1 * C'_k) ^ (M^-1 * K))
We can use the characteristic from above to brute force the i-th byte of
M^-1 * K. Do this for all i to get K completely. Then reconstruct the original
key from it by reversing the key schedule.

* broken box - csaw-ctf-2016
fault attack on textbook RSA signing (not RSA-CRT)
decryption oracle sometimes give different signatures (m^d) for the same m
we see that the different signatures match the size of the modulus in bits
so maybe the server sometimes flips one single bit of the secret exponent d
therefore we get badsig == m^(d (xor) 2^k) % N == m^(d - 2^k) % N
we can test every k because there are only 1024 possible values
if k'th bit in d was 1 and was flipped to 0, then d = d - 2^k so pow(m, d - 2^k) == pow(m, d) / pow(m, 2^k) (mod k)
if k'th bit in d was 0 and was flipped to 1, then d = d + 2^k so pow(m, d + 2^k) == pow(m, d) * pow(m, 2^k) (mod k)
https://github.com/p4-team/ctf/tree/master/2016-09-16-csaw/broken_box

part2: faults only in the 300 least significant bits of d
but there is a theorem stating that we need only n/4 of the LSB bits to recover full d, as long as e is reasonably small
we use LLL-based attack when more than quarter of the secret exponent bits are known
after finding 300 least significant bits of p, we can use Coppersmith method for finding small roots of polynomials modulo p

oracle gives the least significant bit of the decryption of a ciphertext
multiply the ciphertext by 2^e, essentially doubling the plaintext.
With the bit from the LSB oracle, we can now decide if the plaintext would have been reduced modulo N, when multiplied with 2. If it was not reduced, the LSB is 0, since it is an even number.
If it is 1, then the even number got reduced modulo N, giving an odd number.
Therfore we can now say if P is less or greater than N/2. We can now repeat this process for 2P,4P,8P.. further constricting P, until we got the correct value for P

RSA is homomorphic to the multiplication and powers so enc((31*a)^7) == pow(enc(31)*enc(a)%n,7,n)
Pallier is homomorphic to the addition and the multiplication so enc(31*a+12*b+56) == (pow(E(a),31,n**2)*pow(E(b),12,n**2))*E(56)%n**2
and with ElGamal enc(a^7) == [pow(enc(a)[0], 7, q), pow(enc(a)[1], 7, q))]

* the greatest - nuit-du-hack-ctf-qualifications 2014
extract gif file
get some info:
$ gifsicle --xinfo greg.gif
There is no much possibilities for stegano in GIF as the image is made of refs to the colormap so it could be:
  - position of pixels of a given color
  - duplicates or alike in the colormap (e.g. #cccccc and #cccbcc) or other tricks 
So let's dump the colormap:
$ gifsicle --color-info greg.gif
  greg.gif 1 image
  logical screen 500x645
  global color table [256]
  |   0: #FFFFFF      64: #A3835C     128: #1E3E71     192: #769DD1
  |   1: #FCF5F6      65: #A37F81     129: #030915     193: #0F314D
  |   2: #F5E9E8      66: #A27C58     130: #546473     194: #5982BB
[...]
  |  61: #A48A64     125: #675847     189: #4B3A47     253: #000000
  |  62: #A3BCE1     126: #101627     190: #7CA2CD     254: #000000
  |  63: #A38C6B     127: #4C6169     191: #594837     255: #000000
  background 65
  + image #0 500x645
We can spot two oddities:
  - there are quirks in the sorting
  - a normal gif file would start with #000000 and end with #FFFFFF, and then #000000 padding
Googling for "gif stegano colourmap" yields the gifshuffle tool. But ./gifshuffle greg.gif outputs binary garbage and -C outputs gibberish as well.
The tool was probably modified to reverse sort the colormap table. Patch gifshuffle, compile & run to get the flag.

we can use the Date: header and just bruteforce the pid (standard pid_max is 32768)
php reuses seeds in existing mod_php processes so established 20 connections to ensure we get numbers from a fresh Apache child
trying all possible pids took a lot longer than one minute, but once found the first valid pid we can predict what range the next pid will be and greatly reduce the number of tries required
